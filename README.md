Home-related categories (e.g., Home Decor, Household Supplies, Kitchen & Dining) dominate in product purchases.

HD Roku Streaming Device with an average rating of 4.7.


#### 5; Best Seller Anomaly: 

Non-best sellers generated $4.22 billion in revenue, significantly more than best sellers at $429 million. This suggests that volume or variety may influence revenue more than the best seller badge.

#### 7; Top Selling Product by Volume:

Neutrogena Cleansing Fragrance.


## Provided Recommendations based on Insights

#### 1; Explore why non-best sellers dominate revenue: 

Possibly due to broader variety or more competitive pricing.


#### 2; Leverage high-performing categories: 

Focus marketing and stocking on Kitchen & Dining and household-related products.


#### 3; Use review-to-sales ratio for product strategy: 

Products with high sales but low reviews can benefit from incentivized feedback campaigns.


#### 4; Revisit Best Seller Criteria: 

Evaluate how Amazon defines best sellers, as some high-performing products may be excluded.


#### 5; Focus on customer-rated performance:
 Products with higher average ratings (like HD Roku) could be promoted further to boost engagement.
